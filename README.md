# rkperes.dev

Implementation for my personal website.

I'm currently using it to test a few web tools that I don't usually have contact
with at work.

## Toolset

React & TypeScript as basis.

Use:

- ~~Deno (build)~~ It turns out Remix+Deno doesn't work well because of the lack
  of importmaps. Using bun instead.
- Remix (SSR)
- Tailwind (CSS)
- Fly.io (deploy)
